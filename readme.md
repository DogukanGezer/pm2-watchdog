# Mongo Sentinel

## Introduction 🚀

The PM2 Watchdog is a monitoring module designed to track the status of your PM2 processes and detect important changes such as restarts or unintentional exits. By integrating with Slack, it automatically sends detailed notifications to a specified channel when a process is deployed or unexpectedly terminated.

* **Monitors PM2 process events**: Tracks process restarts and exits.
* **Slack Integration**: Sends notifications with important process details directly to a Slack channel. 📩
* **Deploy Detection**: Differentiates between intentional restarts (deployments) and unintentional exits (crashes). 🛠️
